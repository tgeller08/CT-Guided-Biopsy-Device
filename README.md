### Our Mission
We are committed to building a device that improves CT-guided biopsies in order to reduce patient radiation exposure, improve patient comfort, and optimize OR scheduling. 

### Background on CT-Guided Biopsies
A CT-guided biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure in which a CT scanner uses radiation to create image slices of the patient in order to remove a mass of interest. These biopsies can be performed in various areas of the body and can be either deep or superficial. 

CT-guided biopsies vary in difficulty depending on the location of the mass of interest. Superficial masses, masses on limbs, masses on areas with a large surface do not pose much difficulty. In contrast, masses that exist deeper below the skin pose a greater difficulty. It is particularly challenging in locations in the torso that experience constant movement due to the patientâ€™s breathing.  

These more difficult areas require multiple CT scans, leaving the patient in a potentially uncomfortable position for an extended period of time, increasing radiation exposure and reducing OR availability. 

Traditionally, CT interventions use the freehand technique where doctors use their hands to maneuver the needle without any other support. In order to minimize complications, interventional radiologists request frequent CT scans after making adjustments and advance the needle at a slower pace.

### Description of Clinical Need
According to Dr. Fabian Laage Gaupp, Assistant Professor of Vascular and Interventional Radiology and doctor in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at the Yale University School of Medicine, when it comes to deeper biopsies, precision is crucial. The deeper a physician inserts the needle, the more imaging they take to ensure the needle is moving precisely towards the mass. This is particularly challenging for biopsies in the kidney, liver, lower lung and upper abdomen area where there is constant motion from breathing. This is also particularly relevant to pediatric cases where children are at higher risk for radiation exposure and tend to have less patience for lengthy procedures. 

Although clinicians are looking to optimize the procedure and minimize time, the reality is that if a medical device gets too complicated and take even a few seconds longer, physicians are unlikely to use a device in a clinical setting. 

### FDA Regulatory History
Our device uses the SeeStar to position and stabilize the biopsy needle. Our device would follow a similar approval procedure as the SeeStar. 

The SeeStar is classified as a Class 1 GDF medical device, meaning it falls under the category of GUIDED,NEEDLE,SURGICAl and is minimally invasive. This is very promising for our device as FDA approval for Class 1 devices are quicker and more successful than FDA approval for Class 2 and Class 3 medical devices. 

The SeeStar has been in circulation since the early 2000s and our device will not be adding anything invasive to the base SeeStar to turn it from a Class 1 medical device to a Class 2. Our approval process will follow the same lines as the SeeStar.

### Impact on Various Stakeholders
An effective reduction in time needed for a CT-guided biopsy would lead to reduced radiation exposure, improved patient comfort, and more efficient and stable OR scheduling. Improved biopsy time would mean younger patients will be exposed to less radiation. Pediatric patients are 3-4 times more at risk for radiation damage as adults. This presents a huge safety problem when children have to be exposed to diagnostic imaging utilizing radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans. A significant reduction in CT-guided biopsy times would lead to healthier patients especially in pediatric patients. Reduced biopsy time could also reap cost benefits for the hospital as well. A reduction in operation time would lead to more biopsies being able to be performed with less strain on equipment and less energy being used per CT guided biopsy. Currently, a multitude of scans are taken before a mass can be collected. With a reduced operating time due to less scans being needed we can significantly reduce energy costs for CT-guided biopsies. Our proposal for a CT-Guided biopsy offers consistency and stability which is invaluable to a high stakes environment. Regardless of the urgency of the biopsy, increased efficiency leads to smoother and more predictable scheduling.
